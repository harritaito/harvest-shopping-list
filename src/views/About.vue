      This is a small shopping list application. In future I hope it suggests
      seasonal harvest produce to the user.

      Like in December it would suggest Date, Satsuma, Pear, Carrot, Beetroot,
      White cabbage, Pike, Oysters.
    </p>
    <p>However this has not yet been implemented.</p>
